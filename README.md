# Landing-Page-Project

## Task:

To create my own web page from the skills I have learned in previous lessons.

## Completed the Project on 25/07/22

This took me about 5 days to complete. It was definitely the toughest project I have done so far in my coding journey, but well worth the struggle. I have learned so much about html, css and git commits. 

While the webpage is far from perfect, I am very proud of what I have accomplished. My biggest hurdle during this project was forcing elements to act how I wanted them to, particularly when it came to spacing and learning to adjust their padding/margins accordingly. In the future, I would definitely like to come back and try to recreate this page again with an increased knowledge of html and css. 

As always,

I will not give up. I will not give in. I will prevail.
